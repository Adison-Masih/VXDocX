VelocityX includes utilities for controlling the direction of widgets.

| Vx Widget       | Flutter Widget | Extension              |
| --------------- | :------------: | ---------------------- |
| VStack()        |    Column()    | .vStack() or .column() |
| HStack()        |     Row()      | .hStack() or .row()    |
| ZStack()        |    Stack()     | .zStack() or .stack()  |
| VxBlock()       |       -        | -                      |
| VxInlineBlock() |       -        | -                      |

:::tip
You can either use the widgets or their extension methods. Both works equally well. It's your own preference.
:::

### VStack class

A VelocityX VStack widget which is used to display it's children in vertical array. VStack widget does not scroll automatically, If VStack has more children than the available room then it is considered as an error.

If you have N number of widget as children for VStack and you want to scroll them. Then consider using `scorllVertical()` extension.

:::note
`scorllVertical()` is an extension which makes children scroll vertically.
:::

For a Horizontal variant, see [HStack](#hstack-class).

#### VStack Sample

```dart
VStack(
    [
        Text("VelocityX is Super"),
        Text("Sample Text"),
        Text("Yet, Another Sample Text"),
    ],
).scrollVertical().p20();
```

##### Using Extension Method

```dart
    [
        Text("VelocityX is Super"),
        Text("Sample Text"),
        Text("Yet, Another Sample Text"),
    ].vStack().scrollVertical().p20();
```

> Above code displays all the texts in Vertical manner

#### VStack Constructor

```dart
VStack(this.children, // should not be null
      {Key key,
      this.alignment = MainAxisAlignment.start,
      this.crossAlignment = CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      this.axisSize = MainAxisSize.min})
```

#### VStack Properties

- Key **_key_** : Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.

- List<Widgets\> **_children_** : The widgets below this widget in the tree.

- MainAxisAlignment **_alignment_** : How the children should be placed along the main axis.

- CrossAxisAlignment **_crossAlignment_** : How the children should be placed along the cross axis.

- MainAxisSize **_axisSize_** : How much space should be occupied in the main axis.

### HStack class

A VelocityX HStack widget which is used to display it's children in Horizontal array.HStack widget dose not scroll automatically, If HStack has more children then available room then it is considered as an error.

If you have N number of widget as children for HStack and you want to scroll them. Then consider using `scrollHorizontal()` extension.

:::note
`scrollHorizontal()` is an extension which makes children scroll Horizontal.
:::

For a Vertical variant, see [VStack](#vstack-class).

#### HStack Sample

```dart
HStack(
    [
        Text("VelocityX is Super").px12(),
        Text("Sample Text").px12(),
        Text("Yet, Another Sample Text").px12(),
    ],
).scrollHorizontal().p20();
```

##### Using Extension Method

```dart
    [
        Text("VelocityX is Super").px12(),
        Text("Sample Text").px12(),
        Text("Yet, Another Sample Text").px12(),
    ].hStack().scrollHorizontal().p20();
```

> Above code displays all the texts in Horizontal manner

#### HStack Constructor

```dart
  const HStack(this.children, // should not be null
      {Key key,
      this.alignment = MainAxisAlignment.start,
      this.crossAlignment = CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      this.axisSize = MainAxisSize.min})
```

#### HStack Properties

- Key **_key_** : Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.

- List<Widgets\> **_children_** : The widgets below this widget in the tree.

- MainAxisAlignment **_alignment_** : How the children should be placed along the main axis.

- CrossAxisAlignment **_crossAlignment_** : How the children should be placed along the cross axis.

- MainAxisSize **_axisSize_** : How much space should be occupied in the main axis.

### ZStack class

A VelocityX ZStack widget is used to display it's children relative to the edges of its box.
ZSack is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlapped with a gradient color as background.

:::note
Use `alignment` property to align the children of ZStack class.Default Alignment is top start
:::

#### ZStack Sample

```dart
ZStack(
    [
        VxBox().blue500.height(110.0).width(110.0).make(),
        VxBox().green500.height(90.0).width(90.0).make(),
        VxBox().red500.height(70.0).width(70.0).make(),
    ],
    alignment: Alignment.center,
).p20();
```

##### Using Extension Method

```dart
    [
        VxBox().blue500.height(110.0).width(110.0).make(),
        VxBox().green500.height(90.0).width(90.0).make(),
        VxBox().red500.height(70.0).width(70.0).make(),
    ].zStack(alignment: Alignment.center).p20();
```

> Above code displays Overlapping Box(containers) which are align in center

#### ZStack Constructor

```dart
  const ZStack(this.children, // should not be null
      {Key key,
      this.alignment = AlignmentDirectional.topStart,
      this.fit = StackFit.loose,
      this.overflow = Overflow.clip})
```

#### ZStack Properties

- Key **_key_** : Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.

- List<Widgets\> **_children_** : The widgets below this widget in the tree.

- AlignmentGeometry **_alignment_** : How to align the non-positioned and partially-positioned children in the ZStack.

- StackFit **_fit_** : How to size the non-positioned children in the stack.

- Overflow **_overflow_** : Whether overflowing children should be clipped.

### VxBlock class

A VelocityX VxBlock widget is used to display it's children at block-level.
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

:::note
Use `verticalDirection` property to vertically align the children of VxBlock class.Default direction is down
:::

#### VxBlock Sample

```dart
VxBlock(
    children: [
        "VelocityX is Super".text.make().box.height(90).red500.make(),
        "VelocityX increase productivity".text.make().box.red500.make()
    ],
    verticalDirection: VerticalDirection.up,
);
```

> Above code displays Text which is taking full available width of the screen/device

#### VxBlock Constructor

```dart
  VxBlock({
    Key key,
    MainAxisAlignment mainAxisAlignment = MainAxisAlignment.start,
    TextDirection textDirection,
    VerticalDirection verticalDirection = VerticalDirection.down,
    TextBaseline textBaseline,
    List<Widget> children = const <Widget>[],
  });
```

#### VxBlock Properties

- Key **_key_** : Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.

- List<Widgets\> **_children_** : The widgets below this widget in the tree.

- MainAxisAlignment **_alignment_** : How the children should be placed along the main axis.

- TextDirection **textDirection** : Controls the directionality of the text.

- VerticalDirection **verticalDirection** : Controls the vertical direction of childers.

- Overflow **_overflow_** : Whether overflowing children should be clipped.

### VxInlineBlock class

A VelocityX VxInlineBlock widget is used to display it's children in-line at block level.
Using VxInlineBlock you can display children widgets next to each other.

:::note
Use `verticalDirection` property to vertically align the children of VxInlineBlock class.Default direction is down
:::

#### VxInlineBlock Sample

```dart
VxInlineBlock(
    children: [
        "VelocityX is Super".text.make().box.height(90).red500.make(),
        "VelocityX increase productivity".text.make().box.red500.make()
    ],
    verticalDirection: VerticalDirection.up,
);
```

> Above code displays Overlapping Box(containers) which are align in center

#### VxInlineBlock Constructor

```dart
  VxInlineBlock({
    Key key,
    TextDirection textDirection,
    VerticalDirection verticalDirection = VerticalDirection.down,
    TextBaseline textBaseline,
    List<Widget> children = const <Widget>[],
  });
```

#### VxInlineBlock Properties

- Key **_key_** : Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.

- List<Widgets\> **_children_** : The widgets below this widget in the tree.

- TextDirection **textDirection** : Controls the directionality of the text.

- VerticalDirection **verticalDirection** : Controls the vertical direction of childers.

- Overflow **_overflow_** : Whether overflowing children should be clipped.
